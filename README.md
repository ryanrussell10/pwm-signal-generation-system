# pwm-signal-generation-system
This project aims to generate, monitor, and control a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) signal using a STM32F0 Discovery microcontroller. The signal is generated by an NE555 external timer, and a 4N35 optocoupler is used to control the frequency of the PWM signal. A potentiometer is used to control the signal voltage, which is read by the microcontrollerâ€™s internal analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. From the ADC voltage, the microcontroller calculates the potentiometer resistance. This, in turn, triggers a digital-to-analog (DAC) conversion which generates an output voltage.
